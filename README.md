# upDoc

`upDoc` is an experimental comment inconsistency detection tool for Java source code. Given a file under change it checks whether the javadoc comments have been updated for the methods that were changed.

This branch stores the source code of a reduced `upDoc` version used in tandem with `RepliComment` tool for the paper:

Journal of Systems and Software Volume 182, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2021.111069.
