In this folder, you will find the analysis of upDoc after parsing RepliComment CSV outputs.

In particular, you will find the following files:
* pc_high_severity.txt -- cloned comment parts that represent a HIGH severity issue (copy&paste)
* pc_low_severity.txt  -- cloned comment parts that represent a LOW severity issue (likely false positives)
* pc_mild_severity.txt -- cloned comment parts that represent a MILD severity issue (poor info)
* wc_high_severity.txt -- cloned whole comments that represent a HIGH severity issue (unrelated methods)
* wc_mild_severity.txt -- cloned whole comments that represent a MILD severity issue (e.g., overrided methods)
* special_issues.txt   -- general issues affecting the comments (e.g., wrong parameter names)
